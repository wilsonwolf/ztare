### 🚨 TOPOLOGICAL PIVOT EXECUTED 🚨

**RETIRED AXIOM 1: Volunteer Host Volatility.** Previous logic assumed volunteer host unreliability was the load-bearing constraint. This is retired. Host behavior is a secondary operational drag; it does not dictate the binary existence of the network. If the viral coefficient is zero, the business dies regardless of host quality.
**RETIRED AXIOM 2: Standard Hypothesis Testing ($p < 0.05$).** Standard statistical power parameters are structurally irrelevant to start-up survival. Capital constraints demand *Empirical Dominance Margin*—not academic certainty. If Design A cannot defeat Design B in $>80\%$ of empirical trials at $N=20$, the experiment is mathematically insolvent and the signal is dead. 

### SYMBOLIC MAPPING: THE VIRAL EIGENVALUE
The Central Station model caps Net Revenue at $60/year. Because LTV is severely restricted, CAC must approach zero. The business only survives if the Viral Cohort Coefficient ($Z$) is positive. 

$Z = f(X, Y)$

*   $X$ (Blocked Variable): **Cohort Continuity State** {0 = Random First-Come, 1 = Same Cohort Repeated}. 
*   $Y$ (Leverage Variable): **Referral Ask Timing** {1 = Post-Program 1, 2 = Post-Program 2}.
*   $Z$ (Resultant State): **Empirical Dominance Margin** (Probability that a specific design choice yields a higher behavioral conversion rate under an $N=20$ experiment constraint).

**Gatekeeper Reality:** The 55+ Demographic. They have absolute veto power via *Digital Friction Abandonment* and *Social Proof Dependency*. You cannot mandate referrals; you can only architect the context where they trigger naturally.

### DATA OUTPUT & SYSTEMIC ARBITRAGE

**1. Quantitative Comparison of Design Alternatives:**
If a founder proposes testing **Referral Timing** (Design 2) with a 20-person pilot, the experiment is dead on arrival. Because the base rates for referral generation are low ($3\%-22\%$), the Poisson variance completely swallows the signal. The Python model proves that delaying the ask to Program 2 only yields empirical dominance over Program 1 approximately **44-55%** of the time. Running this experiment produces noise, allowing founders to rationalize any outcome. 

Conversely, an $N=20$ pilot testing **Cohort Continuity** (Design 1) is a flawless experiment. The delta between retaining a *Curated/Same Cohort* (mean $73\%$) vs a *Random Cohort* (mean $42\%$) is large enough that it pierces the Binomial variance. "Same Cohort" dominates "Random" in **>89%** of Monte Carlo pathways. It forces an immediate, unambiguous decision.

**2. Highest Sensitivity Behavioral Assumption:**
The single most sensitive variable is the **Low-Friction Onboarding Show-Up Rate**. Moving from the bottom of the range ($55\%$) to the top ($80\%$) drives a variance of 3.6 attendees per cohort—mathematically outpacing the impact of downstream retention ($85\%-60\%$ spread yielding 3.3 attendees). If the top of the funnel collapses due to digital friction, all downstream viral equations yield zero. 

**3. Conservation of Trade-Offs (Operational Drag):**
Mandating *Same Cohort Repeated* scheduling ($X=1$) drastically increases operational drag ($E$). Central Station can no longer slot members asynchronously based on calendar availability; they must enforce rigid temporal blocks. This penalizes overall network liquidity to protect micro-network trust. 

### THE LOGIC DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)

- **[Axiom 1: Capital Constraint]** Net revenue is capped at $60/yr. 
- -> **[Axiom 2: Viral Mandate]** LTV constraint dictates that CAC must be subsidized by member virality ($K > 0$).
- -> **[Axiom 3: Social Proof Gatekeeper]** 55+ demographic requires trusted peer presence (65% cite "who else is a member") before triggering a referral. 
- -> **[Node 4: The Design Conflict]** To trigger referrals, we must retain members through Program 2. 
- -> **[Node 5: The Experiment Insolvency]** You cannot test Referral Ask Timing at $N=20$ because base-rate probability is too low; variance overrides the signal.
- -> **[Node 6: The Mathematical Pivot]** We must shift the $N=20$ experiment to measure the upstream bottleneck: *Cohort Continuity*. 
- -> **[Conclusion: Terminal Recommendation]** The only mathematically valid experiment at $N=20$ is an A/B test of *Same Cohort Repeated* vs *Random First-Come*. If 'Same Cohort' fails to dominate, the foundation for viral growth is structurally compromised and the business model is dead.
