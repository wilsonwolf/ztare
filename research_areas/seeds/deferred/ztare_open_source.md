# ZTARE as Open-Source Developer Tooling

## Core Idea

Release ZTARE not just as a paper artifact but as a GitHub Action: a drop-in adversarial verification layer for AI-generated code and architectural decisions.

Working name: **ZTARE-Check**

---

## Value Proposition

Not a linter. Not a code reviewer. An adversarial firing squad that tries to break the logic of a PR before it merges.

The key differentiator is not "three adversarial agents" — it is the **stage-gated contract**. Each adversarial agent operates under a precommitted Python promotion contract that returns PASS / FAIL / BLOCKED independently. The Action surfaces contract outputs, not vibes. That makes it auditable in a way no existing tool is.

---

## Two Target Use Cases

### 1. AI-generated PR verification
Run ZTARE-Check on any PR where the mutator is an LLM (Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code, etc.). The firing squad attacks the logic of the change, not the syntax. Surfaces: scope overclaims, self-referential falsification, missing falsification suites, unidirectional decay.

### 2. Agentic architectural decisions
Multi-agent systems making load-bearing architectural choices (infra changes, schema migrations, API contracts) run the decision through a ZTARE firing squad before committing. Output: typed verdict with attributed failure mode or clean promotion.

---

## Why Now

Papers 1 and 2 establish the empirical foundation. Paper 3 (contract-governed evaluator hardening) will add the meta-runner evidence. That is a complete enough story to ship a v0.1 Action alongside Paper 3's release.

The timing matters: the multi-agent verification space is forming now. ZTARE has a head start in empirical rigor that prompt-level red-teaming tools do not.

## What Makes It Defensible vs. Competitors

| Property | ZTARE-Check | Generic red-teaming tools |
|---|---|---|
| Stage-gated contracts | Yes — Python, precommitted | No |
| Typed failure attribution | Yes — exploit family + primitive key | No |
| Auditable promotion record | Yes — JSON benchmark evidence | No |
| Domain-transferable | Yes — OOD specimens tested | Usually domain-specific |
| Gaming-resistant | Yes — fixed attacker taxonomy | Usually gameable |

---

## Open Questions Before Shipping

1. What is the minimum viable Action scope? (single-stage vs. full V4 pipeline)
2. Does the fixed Shadow Board taxonomy generalize to non-epistemic PR content?
3. What does the output surface look like for a developer who has not read the papers?
4. License: needs decision before any public release.

---

## Relationship to Papers

- Paper 1: establishes gaming strategies and cross-domain convergence
- Paper 2: establishes recursive epistemic gain via failure→constraint loop
- Paper 3: establishes contract-governed hardening as infrastructure
- ZTARE-Check: the practitioner artifact that makes Paper 3's claims actionable

Do not ship before Paper 3 is accepted or posted. The tool needs the empirical backing to avoid being dismissed as a vibe-based agent wrapper.
