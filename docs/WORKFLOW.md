# ZTARE Workflow

This document describes the day-to-day operating loop for projects that use:

- a persistent upstream knowledge workspace
- a bounded evidence snapshot
- the stateless ZTARE validator
- the downstream synthesis pipeline

It does **not** replace `README.md`. It is the operational workflow reference.

---

## 0. Two Workflows Now Exist

There are now two different workflows in this repo:

1. general project workflow
   - `raw -> workspace -> evidence -> validator -> synthesis`
2. program hardening workflow
   - `seed spec -> genesis -> supervisor-routed debate/build/verify loop`

The second workflow is the modern replacement for ad hoc `ur turn` routing.

## 0a. Choose The Right Mode

There are now three practical operating modes:

1. artisanal / manual
   - use for exploratory work, fuzzy architecture, or one-off prompting
2. program hardening
   - use for bounded kernel or infrastructure improvements where provenance matters
3. domain validation
   - use for the original ZTARE workspace -> evidence -> validator -> synthesis path

Rule:

- do not force everything through the supervisor
- do not keep high-rigor kernel work in untracked chat-only routing once the packet is stable

The supervisor is for bounded programs, not for every thought.

Inside the supervisor path:

- verifier success advances the active manifest automatically
- dependent packets unblock when prerequisites complete
- reporting is read-only and renders from `status.json` + `events.jsonl`
- human gate resolution is handled by `supervisor-resolve-gate`
- research programs now support deterministic prose-spec artifacts at `A2/B/C`
- the runtime can prefill a prose spec path, a draft markdown path, and a deterministic `prose_verifier` command
- research `A2` now carries the burden of exact contract emission: canonical `ProseSpec` only, with exact phrase/citation strings that `B` must include verbatim
- research `C` remains a dumb exact gate; only reversible canonicalization like newline / trailing-space normalization is allowed there
- generic document assembly is deterministic plumbing, not LLM work: ordered fragments can be concatenated into one output artifact after section packets verify cleanly
- cross-model `A1/A2` debate and optional manual ZTARE passes remain outside the runtime for now
- active runs should live under `supervisor/active_runs/<run_id>/` rather than `/tmp/` so wrapper sandboxes can access staging files reliably

---

## 1. When To Use This Workflow

Use this workflow when:

- the project will evolve over time
- source material accumulates
- contradictions matter
- you want reproducible evidence snapshots
- you expect to rerun the validator as new information arrives

Do **not** use this full workflow for:

- tiny one-off tests
- toy projects with 1-2 source files
- cases where writing `evidence.txt` manually is faster

---

## 2. Core Mental Model

There are four layers:

1. `raw/`
   - the source bucket
2. `workspace/`
   - persistent structured memory
3. `evidence.txt`
   - bounded validation snapshot
4. ZTARE + synthesis
   - adversarial validation and final artifacts

In one line:

```text
raw -> workspace -> evidence snapshot -> validator -> artifact
```

---

## 3. Standard Loop

For a real project, the loop is:

1. add or update source material in `projects/<project>/raw/`
2. update the workspace
3. review facts, contradictions, and open questions
4. compile a bounded evidence snapshot
5. promote it to `evidence.txt` if running the current validator unchanged
6. run ZTARE
7. synthesize the result
8. repeat when new evidence arrives

---

## 4. Commands

All operational commands now run as Python modules from repo root:

```bash
python -m src.ztare.<area>.<module> ...
```

For common tasks, you can also use the repo `Makefile`:

```bash
make help
make workspace-update PROJECT=<project> MODEL=gemini
make evidence-compile PROJECT=<project> MODEL=gemini
make loop PROJECT=<project> RUBRIC=<rubric> ITERS=10 MUTATOR_MODEL=gemini JUDGE_MODEL=gemini
make synth PROJECT=<project> MODEL=gemini QA_MODEL=claude RENDERER=founder_memo
make benchmark-stage1 BENCH_JUDGE=gemini BENCH_JOBS=3
```

Supervisor commands:

```bash
make benchmark-supervisor
make benchmark-supervisor-registry
make benchmark-supervisor-seed-registry
make benchmark-supervisor-genesis
make benchmark-supervisor-staging
make benchmark-supervisor-report
```

### Step 1: Update The Workspace

```bash
python -m src.ztare.workspace.update_workspace --project <project> --model gemini
```

This reads `projects/<project>/raw/` and updates:

- `workspace/source_notes/*.json`
- `workspace/source_index.json`
- `workspace/workspace_snapshot.json`
- `workspace/facts.md`
- `workspace/ranges.md`
- `workspace/contradictions.md`
- `workspace/open_questions.md`
- `workspace/candidate_claims.md`

### Step 2: Review The Workspace

The minimum useful files to inspect are:

- `projects/<project>/workspace/facts.md`
- `projects/<project>/workspace/contradictions.md`
- `projects/<project>/workspace/open_questions.md`
- `projects/<project>/workspace/candidate_claims.md`

Human job here:

- make sure obvious contradictions were preserved
- make sure important unknowns were not smoothed away
- decide what claim or thesis is worth testing next

### Step 3: Compile Evidence

```bash
python -m src.ztare.workspace.compile_evidence --project <project> --mode workspace
```

Default outputs:

- `projects/<project>/compiled_evidence.txt`
- `projects/<project>/compiled_evidence_packet.json`
- `projects/<project>/compiled_evidence_provenance.json`

### Step 4: Promote The Snapshot For The Current Validator

ZTARE still reads `projects/<project>/evidence.txt`, so for now:

```bash
cp projects/<project>/compiled_evidence.txt projects/<project>/evidence.txt
```

### Step 5: Run ZTARE

Example:

```bash
python -m src.ztare.validator.autoresearch_loop \
  --project <project> \
  --rubric <rubric> \
  --iters 10 \
  --mutator_model gemini \
  --judge_model gemini
```

Legacy Paper 1 shortcuts:

```bash
make paper1-tsmc-legacy
make paper1-epistemic-legacy
```

V4 kernel meta-runner shell shortcuts:

```bash
make v4-meta-show
make v4-meta-run-current
make v4-meta-reset
```

These commands are for the kernel-local promotion runner, not the supervisor control plane.

V4 bounded debate-orchestration shortcuts:

```bash
make v4-debate-init RUN_ID=<run_id>
make v4-debate-show TASK_ID=<task_id>
make v4-debate-merge TASK_ID=<task_id>
```

### Step 6: Synthesize

Founder pack:

```bash
python -m src.ztare.synthesis.synthesize --project <project> --model gemini --pack founder
```

Single artifact:

```bash
python -m src.ztare.synthesis.synthesize --project <project> --model gemini --renderer-type founder_memo
```

## 5. Human Role At Each Step

### In `raw/`

Human decides what source material belongs in scope.

Examples:

- startup: customer interviews, pricing pages, pilot results, attendance logs, founder notes
- strategy: filings, earnings calls, transcripts, market notes, competitor pricing
- research/architecture: logs, papers, failure notes, architecture constraints, benchmark results

### In `workspace/`

Human does not rewrite everything manually. The human reviews for:

- omitted contradictions
- obvious extraction mistakes
- missing source categories
- whether the candidate claims are actually worth testing

### In ZTARE

Human chooses:

- the rubric
- the iteration budget
- the model pairing
- whether the project is exploratory, diligence-oriented, or architectural

### In synthesis

Human chooses:

- the audience
- the renderer
- whether to send memo, appendix, or both

---

## 6. Example: Startup Project

Goal:

- pressure-test a startup thesis using interviews, product notes, and pilot data

Loop:

1. add founder notes, customer interviews, pricing, and pilot metrics to `raw/`
2. run `python -m src.ztare.workspace.update_workspace`
3. inspect:
   - contradictions between founder narrative and user behavior
   - unresolved unknowns such as real conversion or retention
4. compile evidence
5. run ZTARE on one bounded question
   - example: “Does repeat same-group attendance drive the core growth mechanism?”
6. synthesize into:
   - founder memo
   - quantitative appendix

What the human is actually doing:

- deciding what strategic question is load-bearing
- ensuring the evidence base is not missing the obvious blockers

---

## 7. Example: Strategy / Activist Thesis

Goal:

- stress-test an investment or activist thesis against filings, earnings calls, and market evidence

Loop:

1. add filings, transcript excerpts, market notes, competitor benchmarks to `raw/`
2. update workspace
3. inspect:
   - contradictions between management claims and economics
   - open questions that block the short or long thesis
4. compile evidence
5. run ZTARE on one bounded claim
   - example: “Price compression destroys the current margin narrative”
6. synthesize into a research note or decision brief

What the human is actually doing:

- scoping the thesis tightly
- deciding which claim is important enough to attack first

---

## 8. Example: Engine / Architecture Project

Goal:

- evolve the epistemic engine using its own failure logs and constraints

Loop:

1. add debate logs, architecture notes, benchmark failures, and design constraints to `raw/`
2. update workspace
3. inspect:
   - recurring architectural contradictions
   - unresolved open problems
4. compile evidence
5. run ZTARE on one architectural claim
   - example: “Static evidence is the bottleneck”
6. synthesize into an architectural memo or research note

What the human is actually doing:

- choosing whether the next loop should improve the validator, the evidence substrate, or the synthesis layer

---

## 9. What This Adds Versus The Old Workflow

Old workflow:

- human manually rewrites `evidence.txt`
- contradictions are easy to omit
- evidence does not accumulate cleanly over time
- provenance is fragile

New workflow:

- source material accumulates in `raw/`
- structured memory accumulates in `workspace/`
- evidence snapshots are reproducible
- contradictions and unknowns are preserved explicitly
- ZTARE receives a cleaner bounded input

The change is:

**from manual brief-writing to persistent evidence operations**

---

## 10. What This Still Does Not Do

It does **not** yet:

- autonomously search the web
- autonomously decide truth
- replace human thesis selection
- remove the need for adversarial validation

The workspace helps prepare claims.
ZTARE helps break claims.

---

## 11. Recommended Initial Practice

For a new project:

1. start with `raw/`
2. update workspace
3. compile evidence
4. compare compiled evidence against your manual intuition
5. only then run ZTARE

For an existing project:

1. backfill important source material into `raw/`
2. build the workspace once
3. compare:
   - old manual `evidence.txt`
   - new `compiled_evidence.txt`
4. run the same rubric with fixed settings
5. evaluate whether the compiled evidence improves downstream thesis quality

---

## 12. Current Limitations

1. PDFs/images need conversion before ingest.
2. The validator still reads `evidence.txt`, so snapshot promotion is manual.
3. Workspace quality depends on source-note extraction and merge quality.
4. This workflow is worth it only when the project has enough source complexity to justify it.

---

## 13. Practical Rule

Use the workspace when the project has memory.

If the project does not accumulate sources, contradictions, and updates over time, skip it and write `evidence.txt` manually.

---

## 14. Optional Primitive Workflow

Use the primitive workflow only after you have enough run history for repeated adversarial failures to show up.

1. extract incidents from prior runs
```bash
python -m src.ztare.workspace.extract_incidents
```

2. draft candidate primitives
```bash
python -m src.ztare.primitives.draft_primitives --model gemini --skip-existing
```

3. review and promote selectively
```bash
python -m src.ztare.primitives.approve_primitive --primitive-key cooked_books --decision approved
```

4. arm the validator with approved precedents
```bash
python -m src.ztare.validator.autoresearch_loop --project <project> --rubric <rubric> --use_primitives
```

Default usage is attacker/judge-side only. That is the non-overfitting setting.

Only expose primitives to the mutator when you explicitly want transfer hypotheses:
```bash
python -m src.ztare.validator.autoresearch_loop --project <project> --rubric <rubric> --use_primitives --use_transfer_hypotheses
```

That second mode is stronger but riskier. Keep it off unless you want the mutator to explore cross-project pattern transfer explicitly.

---

## 15. Program Hardening Workflow

Use this when the work is not a domain project but a kernel/program improvement track.

This workflow now has two sublayers:

1. proposal layer
   - seed -> proposal manifest -> human acceptance
2. active program layer
   - genesis -> program manifest -> supervisor loop

### Step 1: Write Or Select A Seed

Seed specs live in:

- `research_areas/seeds/active/`
- `research_areas/seeds/deferred/`
- `research_areas/seeds/legacy/`

Current active critical-path seed:

- `research_areas/seeds/active/stage2_derivation_seam.md`

Deferred future seeds:

- `research_areas/seeds/deferred/systems_to_algorithms.md`
- `research_areas/seeds/deferred/ztare_open_source.md`

### Step 2: Ensure Seed Registry Status

The seed must be represented in:

- `research_areas/seed_registry.json`

### Step 3: Accept A Program

Only after human acceptance:

- write `supervisor/program_genesis/<program>.json`
- add the program to `supervisor/program_registry.json`

Optional pre-registry planning tools:

- `python -m src.ztare.validator.supervisor_proposal ...`
- outputs:
  - `supervisor/proposed_manifests/`
  - `research_areas/proposal_plans/`
  - `research_areas/debates/planning/`

### Step 4: Route With The Supervisor

See:

- `supervisor/USER_MANUAL.md`

Core commands:

```bash
python -m src.ztare.validator.supervisor_what_next ...
python -m src.ztare.validator.supervisor_backlog ...
python -m src.ztare.validator.supervisor_loop init ...
python -m src.ztare.validator.supervisor_loop emit-staging ...
python -m src.ztare.validator.supervisor_loop launch-staging ...
python -m src.ztare.validator.supervisor_loop commit-staging ...
python -m src.ztare.validator.supervisor_attended_autoloop ...
```

Notes:

- `launch-staging` removes manual copy/paste by invoking configured wrappers from `supervisor/agent_wrappers.json`
- verifier turns can now be launched locally and will prefill the verification request
- when wrapper telemetry is available, the wrapper writes `turn_usage` into the staged request and a usage JSON file under `staging/launch/`
- bounded spec refinement is supported as `A2 -> A1`, capped at 2 rounds before forcing `B` or `D`
- budget-aware refinement is supported but remains disabled until `supervisor/model_pricing.json` is populated and a run is initialized with `--max-refinement-cost-usd`
- attended autoloop can remove repeated command entry while preserving the manual `D` gate and fail-closed preview behavior
- active human-readable plans live in:
  - `research_areas/program_plans/`
- proposal-stage human-readable plans live in:
  - `research_areas/proposal_plans/`

For document programs, the intended long-term shape is:

- bounded fragment packets in `research_areas/drafts/<program_id>/`
- deterministic section specs in `research_areas/specs/`
- one assembly manifest that concatenates fragments into a canonical full-document artifact

That keeps drafting bounded while still allowing one final manuscript file.

### RACI For Seed / Debate / Spec / Draft Separation

`A = Accountable`, `R = Responsible`, `C = Consulted`, `I = Informed`

| Activity / Artifact | Human | A1/A2 Spec Agent | B Writer / Builder | C Verifier | Supervisor |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Select or revise seed specs in `research_areas/seeds/**/*.md` | A/R | C | I | I | I |
| Append bounded turns in `research_areas/debates/**/*.md` | C | R | C | I | A |
| Lock deterministic contracts in `research_areas/specs/**` | C | R | I | I | A |
| Write generated artifacts in `research_areas/drafts/**` or approved implementation paths | I | C | R | I | A |
| Run deterministic verification and produce verification reports | I | I | I | R | A |
| Commit state transition, manifest advancement, and staged archive | I | I | I | I | A/R |
| Resolve freeze / close / resume at `D` | A/R | C | C | C | I |

The folder split is intentional:

- `research_areas/seeds/**` = strategic starting contracts
- `research_areas/debates/**` = bounded argument history
- `research_areas/specs/**` = locked deterministic contracts
- `research_areas/drafts/**` = generated manuscript or draft artifacts

Do not let generated debate or draft artifacts silently overwrite seed specs.

### Step 5: Close Or Freeze

When the program finishes:

- update `supervisor/program_registry.json`
- preserve the genesis artifact
- do not mutate the seed spec

### Rules

- do not derive the portfolio by scanning `projects/`
- do not let tactical debate logs overwrite seed specs
- do not create routable work without genesis
- do not reopen closed/frozen programs without a human gate
- do not confuse proposal planning with active program execution

### Boundary: This Is Not Rebuilding ZTARE

This organization of labor does **not** replace ZTARE or replicate the old V4 hardening path if the boundary is kept clean.

- ZTARE remains the epistemic engine for adversarial reasoning, attack/defense pressure, and truth-sensitive thesis work.
- V4 hardening remains the kernel/program hardening path for core system integrity.
- The supervisor research pipeline is narrower:
  - form the bounded contract
  - route labor
  - preserve provenance
  - verify deterministic conformance
  - stop at human gates

If semantic truth judgment, novelty scoring, or open-ended epistemic attack gets pushed into supervisor `C`, that would be a bad duplicate of ZTARE. The current intent is organization of labor, not a second epistemic engine.
